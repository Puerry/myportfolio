    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I’m a high school student who’s super passionate about gaming and tech. Ever since I can remember, I’ve been drawn to video games, and Minecraft has been a huge part of that. I love exploring the endless possibilities of the game and figuring out how to make it even better.</p>
    <p>Concerning Minecraft I am very fan of skript-lang, I have been collaborating for the last 2/3 years with some servers just in the role of scripter. But that doesn't mean I don't program plugins with or mods in java, I just prefer skript.</p>
    <p>Outside of video games I work on somewhat more serious projects and with other programming languages I know, for example Python, Javascript, c#, c++, bash and (a bit) assemby code.
      Other hobbies of mine are Cybersecurity (I have participated in some national competitions), Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrencies. </p>
    <p>Current main project: None</p>
    <p>Current side project: arbitrum trading crypto bot </p>
    <p>Open to commissions: True</p>
